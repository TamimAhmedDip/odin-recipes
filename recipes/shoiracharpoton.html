        <strong>Inquilab Zindabad!</strong>
        <br>
        With Patria or Muerte death and shahadah was the only thing stopping Bangladeshi teens
        from tearing down the 15 year long oppressive Regime
    </p>
    <p>
        The darker the night, the closer the dawn. 
        Anyone who has not experienced the revolution themselves it is impossible to explain.
        With Abu Sayeed's everest-esque courage he had left a generation fuming. All of them 
        placed their open chests in front of the police.
        A Fascist that once felt impossible to replace, fleed, in the most deamening of ways.
        Allah says in the Quran:

        "You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand1 is [all] good. Indeed, You are over all things competent."

        A force of Arrogance, was truly humbled by lord almighty that day.
