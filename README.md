# odin-recipes
Odin Recipe is my first project under "The Odin Project" course, and also my first guided HTML project that I completed fully. 
I tried to encorporate everything I learnt from the HTML basics course. 
The highlight for this project would always be the guidance of using git. This is the first time I have properly used git in my project and I am look forward to use this knowledge as much as possible in the days to come!
